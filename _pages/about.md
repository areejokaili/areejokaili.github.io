I am an Assistant Professor at King Saud University's College of Computer and Information Science (KSU CCIS), where my research centers on Artificial Intelligence technologies that enhance information accessibility. 
Specifically, my work involves leveraging Natural Language Processing techniques to simplify and make sense of data.  I am especially interested in studying and improving the capabilities of systems that perform unsupervised inference from data, such as Topic Modelling. 

<!-- My responsibilities include teaching, supervising graduation projects, and serving on various committees.
-->
Prior to joining the faculty at King Saud University, I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Sheffield under the supervision of <a href="https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/M.Stevenson/">Dr Mark Stevenson</a> and <a href="https://nikosaletras.com/">Dr Nikolaos Aletras</a>. During my time there, 
I was a member of the esteemed (<a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing</a>) research 
group, which is known for being one of the largest and most successful in the UK.

<p>Before starting my PhD, I earned a BSc and MSc in Computer and Information Sciences from King Saud University (KSU). <!--In my Master project, I worked on developing an ensamble machine
 learning models to perform classification on Arabic data.--></P>
