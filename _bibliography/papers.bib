abstract = {Topic modelling is a popular unsupervised method for identifying the underlying themes in document collections that has many applications in information retrieval. A topic is usually represented by a list of terms ranked by their probability but, since these can be difficult to interpret, various approaches have been developed to assign descriptive labels to topics. Previous work on the automatic assignment of labels to topics has relied on a two-stage approach: (1) candidate labels are retrieved from a large pool (e.g. Wikipedia article titles); and then (2) re-ranked based on their semantic similarity to the topic terms. However, these extractive approaches can only assign candidate labels from a restricted set that may not include any suitable ones. This paper proposes using a sequence-to-sequence neural-based approach to generate labels that does not suffer from this limitation. The model is trained over a new large synthetic dataset created using distant supervision. The method is evaluated by comparing the labels it generates to ones rated by humans.},

    abstract = "Topics models, such as LDA, are widely used in Natural Language Processing. Making their output interpretable is an important area of research with applications to areas such as the enhancement of exploratory search interfaces and the development of interpretable machine learning models. Conventionally, topics are represented by their n most probable words, however, these representations are often difficult for humans to interpret. This paper explores the re-ranking of topic words to generate more interpretable topic representations. A range of approaches are compared and evaluated in two experiments. The first uses crowdworkers to associate topics represented by different word rankings with related documents. The second experiment is an automatic approach based on a document retrieval task applied on multiple domains. Results in both experiments demonstrate that re-ranking words improves topic interpretability and that the most effective re-ranking schemes were those which combine information about the importance of words both within topics and their relative frequency in the entire corpus. In addition, close correlation between the results of the two evaluation approaches suggests that the automatic method proposed here could be used to evaluate re-ranking methods without the need for human judgements.",
